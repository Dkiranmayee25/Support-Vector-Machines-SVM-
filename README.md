# Support-Vector-Machines-SVM-
SVM Breast Cancer Classification

This project demonstrates classification of breast cancer tumors using Support Vector Machines (SVM) on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

Features:
- Linear and RBF kernel-based SVM classifiers
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- PCA-based 2D visualization of the decision boundary
- Confusion matrix and classification metrics

Files
- `svm_breast_cancer.py`: Python script for training and visualizing SVM models.
- `breast-cancer.csv`: Dataset file (upload separately).
- `README.md`: Project overview.

How to Run
1. Upload `breast-cancer.csv` to the project folder.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python svm_breast_cancer.py
